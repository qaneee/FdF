#**Welcome to **FdF****

## Overview

**FdF** is a graphics programming project focused on 3D wireframe visualization. The repository implements all main features associated with "Fil de Fer" (wireframe) modeling, commonly found in graphics, engineering, and educational programming projects.

## Features

- **3D Wireframe Visualization:** Load, process, and render 3D models in wireframe format.
- **Graphics Programming:** Efficient graphics rendering and geometric computation.
- **User Interaction:** Responsive controls for manipulating 3D views.
- **Robust Build:** Fully working and tested on target environment(s).
- **Educational:** Well-suited for learning graphical data processing and visualization.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repo:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/qaneee/FdF.git
   ```

2. **Build the project:**
   - Ensure you have the required dependencies (documented in the project files).
   - Run the provided build scripts or use the published instructions:
     ```bash
     make
     ```
     
3. **Run the executable:**
   ```bash
   ./fdF <path_to_data_file>
   ```

## Usage

- Launch the app and use the keyboard/mouse to interact with the wireframe model.
- Supported features, controls, and example data files are provided in the documentation and examples folder (if available).

## Repository Structure

- `src/` — Source code for the main project
